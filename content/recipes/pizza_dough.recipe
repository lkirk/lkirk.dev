This is a barebones pizza dough recipe. The flour amounts are a little light to allow for adjustment later on in the process of the bread making. This means the recipe is relatively amenable to different types of flour (high gluten/whole wheat/all purpose)

--

1 tsp yeast
1 tsp sugar
1 cup water (lukewarm)
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
2 cups flour
   
--

Combine sugar, yeast, lukewarm water in a bowl and mix until dissolved (or mostly dissolved).
Wait ~15 minutes for foam to appear (indicating the yeast is activated). This step is not required for rapid rise yeasts.
Add flour and combine
Adjust until dough is "right"
Kneed for ~5-10 minutes
Rise for ~50 minutes - 1.5 hours (depending on heat/humidity). Has the dough doubled in size?
Punch down and form into a pizza dough.
Bake pizza at 425°F
