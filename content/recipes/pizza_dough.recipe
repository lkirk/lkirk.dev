This is a barebones pizza dough recipe. The flour amounts are a little light to allow for adjustment later on in the process of the bread making. This means the recipe is relatively amenable to different types of flour (high gluten/whole wheat/all purpose)

--

1 tsp yeast
1 tsp sugar
1 cup water (lukewarm)
1 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil
2 cups flour

Combine sugar, yeast, lukewarm water in a bowl and mix until dissolved (or mostly dissolved).
Wait ~15 minutes for foam to appear (indicating the yeast is activated).
Add flour, salt, and oil. Incorporate into a dough.
Adjust by adding flour until dough is "right". You will know when the dough can be kneaded on a floured surface without too much mess.
Knead for ~10 minutes (a stand mixer with a bread hook helps with this).
Rise for ~50 minutes - 1 hour (depending on heat/humidity). The dough should double in size.
Punch down and form into a pizza dough.
Bake pizza at 425Â°F
