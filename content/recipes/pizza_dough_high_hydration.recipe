This is a more precise, high-hydration pizza dough recipe. I use two kinds of flour: high gluten (bread flour) and another type of flour with a bit more flavor (whole wheat, rye, or high gluten whole wheat -- at the moment I'm finding that high gluten whole wheat flour is producing the chewiest results).

--

1.5 tsp yeast
1 tsp sugar
350 g water (lukewarm)
350 g bread flour
50 g alt flour (see notes)
1.5 tsp salt
1 tbsp olive oil

--

Combine sugar, yeast, lukewarm water in a bowl and mix until dissolved (or mostly dissolved).
Wait ~15 minutes for foam to appear (indicating the yeast is activated).
Add flour, salt, and oil. Incorporate into a dough.
Do not adjust this dough, it's meant to be wet.
Knead for ~10 minutes (a stand mixer with a bread hook helps with this).
Rise for ~50 minutes - 1 hour (depending on heat/humidity). The dough should double in size.
Punch down and form into a pizza dough.
Bake pizza at 425°F - 500°F
