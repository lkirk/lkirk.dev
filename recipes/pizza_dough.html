      This is a barebones pizza dough recipe. The flour amounts are a little light to allow for adjustment later on in the process of the bread making. This means the recipe is relatively amenable to different types of flour (high gluten/whole wheat/all purpose)
      <ul>
        <li>1 tsp yeast</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup water (lukewarm)</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li type="1">Combine sugar, yeast, lukewarm water in a bowl and mix until dissolved (or mostly dissolved).</li>
        <li type="1">Wait ~15 minutes for foam to appear (indicating the yeast is activated).</li>
        <li type="1">Add flour, salt, and oil. Incorporate into a dough.</li>
        <li type="1">Adjust by adding flour until dough is "right". You will know when the dough can be kneaded on a floured surface without too much mess.</li>
        <li type="1">Knead for ~10 minutes (a stand mixer with a bread hook helps with this).</li>
        <li type="1">Rise for ~50 minutes - 1 hour (depending on heat/humidity). The dough should double in size.</li>
        <li type="1">Punch down and form into a pizza dough.</li>
        <li type="1">Bake pizza at 425Â°F</li>
      </ol>
